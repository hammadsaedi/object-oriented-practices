# Object Orientated Practices

## Class and Object
A class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class. A class creates a new data type that can be used to create objects. 

When you declare an object of a class, you are creating an instance of that class. Thus, a class is a logical construct. An object has physical reality. An object occupies space in memory while class does not.

### Characteristics of Objects
Objects are characterized by three essential properties: 

<li><b>Identity</b></li>
<p> It is useful to think of an objectâ€™s identity as the place where its value is stored in memory. </p>

<li><b>State</b></li>
<p>The state of an object is a value from its data type. The identity of an object distinguishes one object from another. </p>

<li><b>Behavior:</b></li>
<p> The behavior of an object is the effect of data-type operations. </p>
